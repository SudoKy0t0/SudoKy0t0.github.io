## Overview

- **Machine:** Wingdata
- **Platform:** Hack The Box
- **OS:** Linux
- **Difficulty:** Easy

Wingdata is an easy Linux machine that focuses on fundamental vulnerability research and web application enumeration. It requires a basic understanding of Python scripts and their built-in security mechanisms, along with introductory research into extraction safety policies and related CVEs.

The fully written writeup will be published once the machine is retired. In the meanwhile, if you want to discuss the machine, feel free to contact me on discord!
