## Who am I

Hello! I go by **SudoKy0t0**.

My main interests are:
- Offensive security
- CTFs and labs (a little bit too much)
- Understanding systems and then breaking them
- Vulnerability research and exploit development

This site exists mainly as:
- A personal knowledge base
- A place to document things I don’t want to forget
- A reference during CTFs and real-world labs
- A space to collect my research and investigations

---

## Background

I spend most of my time working with:
- Linux and Windows
- Networking
- Web applications
- Active Directory environments

I enjoy going deep into:
- Why something works
- Why something breaks
- How to reproduce it reliably
- How systems behave under the hood

## A little bit more personal

- I like cats (as you might have guessed)
- I've been studying cybersecurity for about a year
- I’m currently working toward my first certification: **OSCP**
- I enjoy deep technical research
- I like comparing results and sharing findings, so feel free to reach out!
- +100 hackthebox machines pwned, road to 200
